    "Noise was simulated for one tube in each telescope.  We observed according to a 10-day schedule without Sun or Moon avoidance. For Chile, the schedules already emulate the maximum observing efficiency.  For simplicity, the Pole schedules only    include one full scan of the respective patch per day.  As a result, the Pole observing efficiencies are 46.29% (SAT) and 37.23% (LAT). These efficiencies must be accounted for by downweighting the Pole noise and atmospheric maps with their      scheduled efficiences.\n",
